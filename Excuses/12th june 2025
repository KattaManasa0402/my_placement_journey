It was my second day today at samsung ..
its 23:01 pm now..
i genuinely feel i am doing no productive stuff..
i feel i am completely wasting my time on something that is not going to gurantee me anything.
i dont know uptil when i need to do this.
I feel like getting stuck on this journey of DSA+aptitude+cs fundamentals --- nothing outside that
just keep going ..
