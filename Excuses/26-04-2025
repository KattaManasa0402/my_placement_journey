I seriously feel like giving up.
My DRDO internship is pending .
Unable to proceed with the firebase set up for project 
its been days since i have tried to resolve the errors and feel lost but dont know if i am going on the right path or not .
I feel if i just complete this backend part properly 
Rest i can manage any sort of crud application myself .
