Hey so i get that there has been a gap from my side to push anything on github ..
But trust me i feel , i am lagging behind a lot ..
I dont know my main goal is to complete the cs fundamentals section from the interview perspective so that rest of the time i just need to keep revising everyday.
Mannu let me tell u one thing ..
Just do not give up 
Make sure to cover as much of DBMS , OS ,OOPS concepts by today 
I need to cover the DSA questions too
