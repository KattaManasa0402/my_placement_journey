Didnt go to college today ..
I am genuinely tired!!!
Should i just take some rest ...
I feel no matter how hard i work, in the end i will be left with nothing.
Not having fear of loosing but i fear to be that unlucky creature on this planet .
I will always get things late .
I agree that everything takes time.
Everything happens for a reason .
But yes ...just want to tell u future manasa , i promise , i won't give up ..
I hope one day u come , open this repo named "Excuses" and smile saying that "Thank you for not giving up!!!"
Keep going manasa.
