Its 19th of december , my end term exams will be starting from 3rd of january , 2024.
I did not do well in my midsems .
I was into this placement coordinator work.
I was more into participating for hackathons .
I am not focused.
I know i can be better than this.
Securing  a 9 + cgpa consecutively for 2 sems just to mess this up wasn't my plan !!!!
At the same time i am disappointed to not being able to make a single good project.
My dream of clearing the walmart code hers oa !!!!!!!  will remain as a dream 
I havent even started dynamic programming !!!!!
I dont know where will this take me 
Will keep trying till i secure a good internship!!!!
KATTTTAAAAAAAAA U CAN DO THISSSS
