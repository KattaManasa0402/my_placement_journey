Hey 👋! So today I am supposed to solve the sum of subarray ranges 🤔, but in order to solve this question, I need to understand subarray minimum 📉. Which will take me some more time to solve 🕒.

So, I am guilty of not pushing my code today 😔, but still wanted to make a commit (stating my excuse) 😅.

⚠️ Sorry, future Katta 🚀—next time, no excuses allowed! 💪🔥
