hey so ..
I had attended a web3 hackathon named  - UNFOLD'24..
I genuinely tried to understand about how things work but was blank.
I am at a stage where i need to keep solving DSA till i crack a good company!
But i dont like DSA
I genuinely dont.
I am doing it just to crack my DSA interview 
I am more interested to learn development
I feel great to see beautiful websites that have various features and also how the backend can be connected to it.
I dont know what is out there in future but will surely try my best !!!
KEEP GOING KATTAAA!!!
