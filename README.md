# My Coding Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About Me

Hi, I'm Katta Manasa, a computer science enthusiast currently working on enhancing my problem-solving and development skills. This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, along with my personal projects that I am building along the way.

## My Goal

Until I get placed in a good company, I plan to continue pushing my progress here. The goal is to keep improving my coding skills, learning new concepts, and experimenting with new technologies. Here's what I will be doing:

### ðŸš€ **Solving DSA Problems:**
- I'll be solving various problems on **LeetCode** and **other platforms**.
- Every time I solve a problem, Iâ€™ll commit the solution to this repository so I can track my progress.
- I will also work on improving my problem-solving speed and efficiency over time.

### ðŸ’» **Development Projects:**
- Apart from DSA, Iâ€™ll also work on **development-related projects**.
- These can range from building web applications to experimenting with different programming languages and frameworks.
- I plan to build full-stack projects, participate in open-source development, and showcase my skills through personal projects.

## My Learning Progress

I will keep updating my journey here, and you can track my progress through the **GitHub commits**. You'll find the following:

- Solutions to algorithm problems.
- Small development projects and experiments.
- Projects showcasing my coding and technical skills.

### Current Focus:
- **DSA**: Solving problems related to **arrays**, **dynamic programming**, **graphs**, and more.
- **Development**: Building web applications and exploring **React** and **Node.js**.

## Letâ€™s Connect!
