// hey so this is the first question i did under greedy algorithm approach 
//At each step, you give the smallest cookie that is big enough to the child with the smallest greed.

Why? Giving a bigger cookie to a less greedy child may waste the bigger cookie, which could satisfy a greedier child later.

//CODE 
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        int l=0;
        int r=0;
        int c=0;
        sort(g.begin(),g.end());
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        while(l<s.size() && r<g.size()){
            if(s[l]>=g[r]){
                c+=1;
                r++;
            }
            l++;
        }
        return c;

    }
};
